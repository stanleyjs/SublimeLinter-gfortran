SublimeLinter-gfortran
=========================


This (unofficial) linter plugin for [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter) provides an updated interface to [SublimeFortran](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Fortran).  It is a bugfix on SublimeFortran to work with SublimeLinter in 2019.
It will be used with files that have the "Modern Fortran" syntax.
